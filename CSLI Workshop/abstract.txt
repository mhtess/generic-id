Generic sentences (e.g. "Birds lay eggs") present two distinct puzzles for researchers. First, providing an adequate semantics for generic statements has proved notoriously difficult (Krifka et al. 1995). Among the problems for providing such a semantics include the fact that generics allow for exceptions (e.g. only adult, female birds lay eggs). Second, no natural language has a distinct marker of genericity, presenting speakers and listeners with the difficult tasks of encoding and interpreting generic meanings, respectively.

Recent experimental work has shed light on these two questions. On the one hand, Tessler & Goodman (2016) use Rational Speech Act models (RSA; Frank & Goodman 2012, Goodman & Stuhlm√ºller 2013), a type of recursive Bayesian models of pragmatic reasoning, to provide a simple semantics of generic statements that nonetheless captures many of the puzzling properties of generics. On the other hand, Crone & Frank (2016) examine the contribution of various morphosyntactic features to the interpretation of sentences as generic or non-generic, arguing that generic interpretations arise when listeners cannot ground expressions as referring to particular entities or events.

Here, we unify these two strands of research to provide a wholistic pragmatic account of generic meanings for statements with different morphosyntactic features. We adopt an RSA model in which expressions are systematically ambiguous between a generic and a non-generic interpretation. Using the semantics for generic statements proposed in Tessler & Goodman (2016) and separate non-generic semantics for each message depending on its morphosyntactic features, we are able to provide a pragmatic account of the patterns described in Crone & Frank (2016).
